## Philosophy

Blanket.js is a code coverage tool for javascript that aims to be:

1. Easy to install
2. Easy to use
3. Easy to understand

Blanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.

## Mechanism

JavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).

Blanket works in a 3 step process:

1. Loading your source files using a modified [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)/[Require](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require) script
2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.
3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.

## Install

Download the appropriate version of blanket.js for your test runner:  
**QUnit**: [blanket.js for QUnit](https://raw.github.com/Migrii/blanket/live/dist/qunit/blanket.js)  

**Mocha**: `npm install blanket` (NOTE: The Blanket NPM package requires Node 0.8.*)    

Or [build it yourself](#roll-your-own).  


## Configure

Reference the script in your test runner.

**QUnit**: `<script src="blanket.js"></script>`  
The add the data attribute `data-cover` to any script file you want covered.   
(Ex: `<script src="mylibrary.js data-cover></script>` )  

**Mocha**: `require("blanket")(<pattern-for-source-files>);` The argument passed is a string (or regex) that refers to the folder where the source scripts are stored.  
*Note: This require statement <strong>must</strong> be placed before the require statement of any scripts that you want covered.*  

In the browser, you can also avoid using the data-cover attributes by using a string/regex to denote which files to load:  
`<script> blanket.loadOnly = "/src/"; </script>`  
This is useful in certain situations, and neccessary when your test runner uses requirejs to load your source files.

## Use

**QUnit**: Run the tests (with the 'Enable Coverage' box checked) and you'll see the coverage statistics appended below the test results.

**Mocha**: Use the built-in reporters to output coverage details, i.e. `mocha -R html-cov > coverage.html`  

## Continuous Integration

You can use the [travis-cov](https://github.com/alex-seville/travis-cov) reporter, to integrate Blanket.js with an instance of Travis CI:

1. `npm install travis-cov`
2. Add to your package.json,  

```   
"scripts": {   
         "test": "mocha -R travis-cov"   
       },   
       "travis-cov-threshold": <number>  
```   

If your CI tests aren't run with mocha, but are instead run with qunit & phantomjs, you can use the following configuration:

```     
"scripts": {   
         "test": "phantomjs ./node_modules/travis-cov/phantom_runner.js path-to-your-testrunner"   
       },   
       "travis-cov-threshold": <number>  
```   

When you commit your code to Travis the coverage results will be compared against the threshold and will fail if any files fall below the threshold.

## Roll your own

1. `git clone git@github.com:Migrii/blanket.git`  
2. `cd /blanket/lib`  
3. `node builder.js <runner>` where runner is qunit for browser based (for the moment).
4. Your newly rolled file can be found at `/dist/qunit/blanket.js`

A minified and unminfied copy of the source will be created.  
We plan on adding a variety of different command line options to allow you to create a version of blanket customized for your needs.  
Let us know what you'd like to see!

## Development

**All development takes place on the LIVE branch.  Ignore master, it is unused at the moment.**

If you're looking for a place to contribute, the ['low priority' issues](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/issues?labels=low+priority&page=1&state=open) are probably a good introduction to the project.
