## Getting Started

Please see the following guides for using Blanket.js:

**Browser**
* [Getting Started](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_browser.md) (Basic QUnit usage)
* [Intermediate](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/master/docs/intermediate_browser.md) (Other test runners, global options)
* [Advanced](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/master/docs/advanced_browser.md) (writing your own reporters/adapters)

**Node**
* [Getting Started](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/master/docs/getting_started_node.md) (basic mocha setup)
* [Intermediate](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/blob/master/docs/intermediate_node.md) (mocha testrunner, travis-ci reporter)

## Philosophy

Blanket.js is a code coverage tool for javascript that aims to be:

1. Easy to install
2. Easy to use
3. Easy to understand

Blanket.js can be run seamlessly or can be customized for your needs.

## Mechanism

JavaScript code coverage compliments your existing JavaScript tests by adding code coverage statistics (which lines of your source code are covered by your tests).

Blanket works in a 3 step process:

1. Loading your source files using a modified [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)/[Require](http://nodejs.org/api/globals.html#globals_require) script
2. Parsing the code using [Esprima](http://esprima.org) and [node-falafel](https://github.com/substack/node-falafel), and instrumenting the file by adding code tracking lines.
3. Connecting to hooks in the test runner to output the coverage details after the tests have completed.


## Roll your own

1. `git clone git@github.com:Migrii/blanket.git`  
2. `npm install`  
3. Add your custom build details to the grunt.js file under `concat`
3. `grunt buildit` 

A minified and unminfied copy of the source can be created (see the `min` task).  

## Development

**All development takes place on the MASTER branch.**  
**Your pull request must pass all tests (run `npm test` to be sure) and respect all existing coverage thresholds**

If you're looking for a place to contribute, the ['low priority' issues](https://github.com/Migrii/blanket/issues?labels=low+priority&page=1&state=open) are probably a good introduction to the project.
